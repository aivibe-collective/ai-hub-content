# RAS-ETH-002: Energy + Carbon Tracking Tools for AI Implementers

## Introduction: The Growing Footprint of AI

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming industries, but its computational demands are significant and growing rapidly. Training large models, running complex inference, and managing the underlying data infrastructure consume substantial amounts of energy. This energy consumption translates directly into a carbon footprint, primarily through the electricity used, which is often generated from fossil fuels.

As AI becomes more pervasive, its environmental impact is becoming increasingly apparent and a subject of global concern. For AI implementers, understanding and managing this impact is no longer optional. It's crucial for responsible development, cost management, and meeting growing expectations for sustainability from customers, investors, and regulators.

This guide provides an overview of why tracking energy usage and carbon emissions in AI is important, explores available tools, offers guidance on their implementation, and outlines a framework for benchmarking your AI's environmental performance.

## Understanding Energy and Carbon in AI

AI's energy consumption occurs throughout its lifecycle, primarily during:

*   **Training:** Especially for large, complex models requiring extensive computation over long periods.
*   **Inference:** While often less energy-intensive per operation than training, high-volume inference (e.g., millions of daily predictions) can accumulate significant energy use.
*   **Data Infrastructure:** The servers, storage, networking, and cooling systems in data centers that host AI workloads.

The **carbon footprint** of AI is largely determined by the **source of electricity** powering these operations. This falls under **Scope 2 emissions** (indirect emissions from the generation of purchased energy). The carbon intensity of electricity varies significantly by location and time of day, depending on the local power grid's mix of fossil fuels, renewables, and nuclear energy.

**Why Tracking is Challenging:**

*   **Distributed Systems:** AI workloads often run across numerous servers, potentially in different locations or cloud regions.
*   **Shared Infrastructure:** AI often runs on shared data center resources (physical or virtualized), making it hard to isolate energy use solely attributable to a specific AI task.
*   **Hardware Variation:** Different GPUs, CPUs, and other accelerators have varying power profiles.
*   **Dynamic Workloads:** Energy consumption fluctuates based on the task (idle, training, inference), model size, batch size, etc.

Despite these challenges, various tools and methodologies are emerging to provide visibility into this often-hidden impact.

## Why Track? Aligning with Mission Pillars

Tracking AI's energy and carbon footprint directly supports critical organizational goals, particularly within the framework of Sustainability and Economic Sustainability.

### Sustainability

*   **Environmental Responsibility:** Directly addresses the environmental impact of AI, contributing to efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and combat climate change.
*   **Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR):** Demonstrates a commitment to sustainable practices, enhancing brand reputation and meeting stakeholder expectations.
*   **Compliance and Reporting:** Prepares organizations for potential future regulations on digital emissions and enables accurate sustainability reporting (e.g., CDP, GRI).
*   **Contribution to Global Goals:** Supports broader sustainability initiatives like the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by promoting resource efficiency in a key technological domain.
*   **Enabling Green AI:** Provides the data needed to identify and implement strategies for reducing AI's footprint, such as optimizing models, using more efficient hardware, or scheduling workloads based on grid carbon intensity.

### Economic Sustainability

*   **Cost Reduction:** Energy is a significant operational cost for compute-intensive AI. Tracking energy usage provides the data needed to identify inefficiencies and reduce electricity bills.
*   **Operational Efficiency:** Understanding energy consumption patterns can reveal opportunities to optimize infrastructure utilization, model architecture, and training/inference processes for better performance per watt.
*   **Competitive Advantage:** Developing and promoting "green AI" solutions can be a differentiator in the market, attracting environmentally conscious customers and partners.
*   **Risk Management:** Proactively managing energy costs and carbon emissions mitigates risks associated with rising energy prices, carbon taxes, and potential future regulatory penalties.
*   **Investor Relations:** Increasingly, investors consider Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors. Demonstrating control and reduction of AI's environmental impact can improve investor confidence and access to capital.

By tracking, AI implementers can transform environmental concerns into actionable insights that drive both ecological responsibility and economic efficiency.

## Energy + Carbon Tracking Tools for AI

Tools for tracking AI's energy and carbon footprint operate at different levels, from code libraries monitoring specific processes to cloud provider dashboards aggregating usage. Here's an overview of common categories and examples:

1.  **Code-Level Libraries:**
    *   Integrated directly into AI training or inference scripts.
    *   Measure power consumption of specific hardware (GPUs, CPUs) during execution.
    *   Estimate carbon emissions based on power usage and grid carbon intensity data (often fetched via APIs).
    *   *Examples:*
        *   **CodeCarbon:** Python library that estimates the CO2 emissions of computing. Easy to integrate, tracks CPU and GPU power, uses location data for grid intensity.
        *   **MLCO2:** Python library focused on tracking GPU energy usage and estimating carbon emissions.

2.  **Cloud Provider Tools & Dashboards:**
    *   Offered by major cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP).
    *   Provide reporting on energy usage and estimated carbon emissions associated with your cloud services, including compute instances used for AI.
    *   Often integrated with cost management tools, showing the energy cost component.
    *   Focus on aggregated service usage rather than specific code executions.
    *   *Examples:*
        *   AWS Customer Carbon Footprint Tool
        *   Azure Sustainability Calculator
        *   Google Cloud Carbon Footprint

3.  **Hardware Monitoring Tools:**
    *   Monitor power consumption at the hardware level.
    *   Useful for understanding the baseline power draw of specific components.
    *   Require integration or correlation with AI workload tracking.
    *   *Examples:*
        *   `nvidia-smi`: Command-line utility for NVIDIA GPUs, provides power usage (wattage).
        *   Intel Power Gadget.

4.  **Data Center Infrastructure Management (DCIM) / Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE):**
    *   Infrastructure-level metrics, less directly controlled by AI implementers unless managing their own facilities.
    *   PUE measures the efficiency of a data center (Total Data Center Energy / IT Equipment Energy). Lower PUE means more energy goes to compute vs. cooling, lighting, etc.
    *   Relevant when choosing cloud regions (providers often report PUE) or designing on-premise AI infrastructure.

## Implementation Guides (High-Level)

Implementing tracking tools varies based on the tool and your AI environment. Here are simplified steps for common scenarios:

### 1. Implementing Code-Level Tracking (Example: CodeCarbon)

This is suitable for tracking the energy and carbon footprint of specific Python scripts or functions used for training or inference.

**Steps:**

1.  **Install:** `pip install codecarbon`
2.  **Import:** Add `from codecarbon import EmissionsTracker` to your script.
3.  **Track:**
    *   Use a context manager:
        ```python
        from codecarbon import EmissionsTracker

        tracker = EmissionsTracker()
        tracker.start()

        # Your AI training/inference code here
        # model.fit(...) or model.predict(...)

        emissions_data = tracker.stop()
        print(emissions_data)
        ```
    *   Use a decorator for a function:
        ```python
        from codecarbon import track_emissions

        @track_emissions
        def train_my_model(...):
            # Your training code

        train_my_model(...)
        ```
4.  **Configure (Optional):** Specify project name, output directory, tracking interval, or even your specific location (for more accurate grid data).
5.  **Analyze Output:** CodeCarbon creates files (e.g., `emissions.csv`) logging metrics like `cpu_power`, `gpu_power`, `country`, `carbon_emissions` (in kg CO2eq).

**Benefit:** Gives you fine-grained data tied directly to your AI code execution.

### 2. Using Cloud Provider Sustainability Dashboards

This is suitable for understanding the aggregated footprint of your AI workloads running on cloud infrastructure.

**Steps:**

1.  **Locate:** Log in to your cloud provider console (AWS, Azure, GCP).
2.  **Navigate:** Find the "Sustainability," "Carbon Footprint," or "Cost Management" section. These reports are often found near billing or cost explorer tools.
3.  **View Reports:** Explore pre-built reports showing estimated carbon emissions over time, potentially broken down by service (e.g., EC2 instances, Sagemaker jobs, AI Platform jobs) or region.
4.  **Analyze:** Identify which services or regions contribute most to your footprint. Some providers might offer insights into the carbon intensity of different regions.

**Benefit:** Provides an overview of your total cloud AI impact and helps identify high-impact services or regions.

### 3. Basic Hardware Monitoring (Example: `nvidia-smi`)

Useful for getting real-time power draw of GPUs.

**Steps:**

1.  **Access:** Open a terminal on the machine running the GPU workload.
2.  **Run:** Execute `nvidia-smi`.
3.  **Observe:** Look for the "Power" section, often showing current power draw in Watts (W) and the power limit.

**Benefit:** Provides direct power measurement for specific hardware, useful for comparing different GPU types or monitoring load impact. Requires manual logging or scripting to track over time.

## Benchmark Framework

A simple framework for benchmarking the energy and carbon footprint of your AI implementations can help you make informed decisions about models, hardware, and configurations.

**Conceptual Framework:**

1.  **Define Scope:** Clearly identify what you are benchmarking (e.g., training a specific model, performing inference on a dataset, comparing two different model architectures, comparing two different hardware setups).
2.  **Choose Metrics:** Decide what you will measure and compare. Key metrics include:
    *   **Energy Consumption:** Kilowatt-hours (kWh) per training run, per 1000 inferences, or per unit of performance (e.g., kWh/accuracy).
    *   **Carbon Emissions:** Kilograms of CO2 equivalent (kgCO2e) per training run, per 1000 inferences, or per unit of performance (kgCO2e/accuracy).
    *   **Cost:** Energy cost per training run or per 1000 inferences (requires mapping kWh to electricity price).
    *   **Performance:** Include relevant AI performance metrics (accuracy, inference time, throughput) to ensure you're not just minimizing energy but optimizing the *energy-performance trade-off*.
3.  **Select Tracking Tools:** Choose tools appropriate for your defined scope (CodeCarbon for code-level, cloud tools for service-level, etc.). Ensure consistency in how you apply the tools across benchmarks.
4.  **Establish a Baseline:** Measure the energy/carbon footprint of your current or initial implementation under typical conditions.
5.  **Measure Variations:** Run your AI task with different configurations, systematically changing one variable at a time (e.g., different model size, different batch size, different hardware, different cloud region if applicable). Use your chosen tracking tools to record metrics for each variation.
6.  **Analyze Results:** Compare the energy, carbon, cost, and performance metrics across all variations relative to the baseline.
    *   Which configuration uses the least energy/emits the least carbon for a given level of performance?
    *   What is the energy/carbon cost of achieving higher performance or accuracy?
    *   Does switching hardware or cloud regions significantly impact the footprint?
7.  **Identify Optimization Opportunities:** Based on the analysis, pinpoint areas for improvement (e.g., optimizing model architecture, selecting more efficient hardware, leveraging lower-carbon cloud regions, optimizing hyperparameters for efficiency).
8.  **Iterate:** Implement optimizations and repeat the benchmarking process to measure the impact of your changes and continue improving.

**Challenges in Benchmarking:**

*   **Reproducibility:** Ensuring identical conditions (data, code, environment, background processes) for each test run.
*   **Grid Intensity Variation:** The carbon footprint for the same energy use can vary hourly or daily based on the grid mix. Consider using average intensity or running tests at consistent times if possible.
*   **Tool Accuracy:** Remember that code-level tools provide *estimates* based on power readings and external data.

## Limitations and Challenges of Tracking Tools

While powerful, current tracking tools have limitations:

*   **Estimation vs. Measurement:** Many tools estimate power consumption based on hardware specifications and utilization heuristics, rather than directly measuring power draw at the chip level (which requires specialized hardware).
*   **Scope:** Most AI-specific tools focus on the compute phase (training/inference) and may not capture the full lifecycle impact, including data storage, data transfer, and the embodied carbon of the hardware itself.
*   **Dependency on External Data:** Carbon emission estimates rely heavily on the accuracy and granularity of external grid carbon intensity data, which may not be available for all locations or times.
*   **Integration Complexity:** Integrating tracking into complex MLOps pipelines or distributed training setups can require significant engineering effort.
*   **Lack of Standardization:** Different tools may use different methodologies or data sources, making direct comparison of results across tools difficult.

Despite these challenges, starting with readily available tools provides valuable insights and is a crucial first step towards more sustainable AI practices.

## Conclusion and Next Steps
