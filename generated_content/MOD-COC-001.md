# Community Code of Conduct (MOD-COC-001)

## 1. Introduction: Our Community Commitment

Welcome! This document outlines our Community Code of Conduct (CoC). It serves as a guide to the expected standards of behavior for everyone participating in our community spaces, both online and offline.

**Why is a Code of Conduct Important?**
A clear CoC is essential for fostering a positive, safe, and productive environment where everyone feels welcome and respected. It ensures that:
*   Expectations for behavior are clear and transparent.
*   Participants understand their rights and responsibilities.
*   A framework exists for addressing unacceptable behavior constructively.
*   Our community remains a place where diverse individuals can collaborate and thrive.

By participating in this community, you agree to abide by this Code of Conduct.

## 2. Main Content: Understanding Our Code of Conduct

### Key Concepts

*   **Community:** Refers to all participants, including members, contributors, maintainers, event attendees, speakers, sponsors, volunteers, and staff, interacting in any community-managed space (e.g., forums, chat channels, repositories, mailing lists, events).
*   **Expected Behavior:** Actions and attitudes that contribute positively to the community environment.
*   **Unacceptable Behavior:** Actions and attitudes that detract from a positive community environment, including harassment, discrimination, and disrespectful conduct.
*   **Enforcement:** The process by which CoC violations are addressed.

### How It Works: Our Shared Expectations (The Rules)

We are dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

**Expected Behaviors:**

*   **Be Respectful:** Treat everyone with courtesy and consideration. Value diverse viewpoints and experiences. Disagree respectfully and constructively.
*   **Be Welcoming and Inclusive:** Actively work to create an environment where people of all backgrounds feel safe and included.
*   **Be Collaborative:** Work together effectively. Offer and accept constructive feedback gracefully. Credit others for their contributions.
*   **Be Considerate:** Be mindful of how your words and actions affect others. Think before you speak or type.
*   **Be Professional:** Conduct yourself professionally, even in informal settings. Refrain from inappropriate or disruptive behavior.
*   **Assume Good Intent (but address impact):** Start by assuming others mean well, but address behavior that has a negative impact, regardless of intent.

**Unacceptable Behaviors:**

The following behaviors are considered unacceptable within our community:

*   **Harassment:** Any behavior that creates a hostile environment, including offensive verbal comments related to protected characteristics (listed above), deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.
*   **Discrimination:** Treating individuals unfairly based on protected characteristics.
*   **Bullying:** Intimidating, degrading, or humiliating others.
*   **Trolling:** Deliberately posting inflammatory, extraneous, or off-topic messages with the primary intent of provoking readers into an emotional response or disrupting normal on-topic discussion.
*   **Doxing:** Publishing private or identifying information about others without their explicit consent.
*   **Personal Attacks:** Insulting or demeaning other participants.
*   **Threats or Incitement of Violence:** Making threats against individuals or groups, or encouraging violence.
*   **Other Conduct:** Any other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional or community setting.

### Applications

This Code of Conduct applies to:

*   **All Community Spaces:** Online forums, chat servers (e.g., Slack, Discord), mailing lists, code repositories (issues, pull requests, comments), wikis, blogs, social media, etc.
*   **Community Events:** Conferences, meetups, workshops, webinars (both attendees and presenters/organizers).
*   **Direct Interactions:** Private communications related to community activities.

### Limitations

*   **Not Exhaustive:** This CoC cannot list every possible form of unacceptable behavior. We expect participants to act in the spirit of the CoC.
*   **Requires Active Participation:** A CoC is only effective if the community actively upholds it through positive behavior and appropriate reporting.
*   **Context Matters:** Interpretation and enforcement will consider the context of the behavior.

## 3. Relation to Mission Pillars

*(Note: Assuming standard community pillars. Replace/adapt these if your organization has specific named pillars.)*

### Pillar: Inclusivity & Diversity

This Code of Conduct directly supports our commitment to Inclusivity and Diversity by:
*   Explicitly prohibiting discrimination and harassment based on a wide range of protected characteristics.
*   Setting the expectation that all participants actively work to create a welcoming environment for people from all backgrounds.
*   Ensuring that diverse perspectives can be shared without fear of hostility or marginalization.

### Pillar: Respect & Civility

Respect and Civility are foundational to this CoC. It promotes these values by:
*   Defining respectful communication and interaction as the standard.
*   Clearly outlining disrespectful behaviors (like personal attacks and bullying) as unacceptable.
*   Encouraging participants to value differing viewpoints and engage in constructive disagreement.

### Pillar: Collaboration & Openness

A safe and respectful environment, as fostered by the CoC, is essential for effective Collaboration and Openness:
*   Participants feel safer sharing ideas, asking questions, and contributing when they trust they will be treated respectfully.
*   The CoC helps prevent disruptive or toxic behavior that can shut down collaboration.
*   It encourages giving and receiving feedback constructively, a key element of open collaboration.

### Pillar: Safety & Well-being

The CoC prioritizes the Safety and Well-being of all community members by:
*   Providing clear guidelines against harassment, intimidation, and threats.
*   Establishing reporting mechanisms for individuals experiencing or witnessing unacceptable behavior.
*   Creating a predictable environment where participants understand behavioral boundaries, reducing anxiety and promoting psychological safety.

### Pillar: Accountability & Enforcement

This CoC is meaningless without Accountability and Enforcement. It supports this pillar by:
*   Clearly stating that participation is conditional on adhering to the CoC.
*   Outlining unacceptable behaviors and the potential consequences.
*   (Implicitly, though often detailed in a separate enforcement guide) Establishing a process for reporting violations and how they will be investigated and addressed by community leadership or a dedicated committee. This ensures fairness and transparency in upholding community standards.

## 4. Conclusion: Upholding Our Community Standards

This Code of Conduct outlines our shared commitment to maintaining a respectful, inclusive, and collaborative community. It defines expected behaviors, identifies unacceptable conduct, and underscores our dedication to creating a safe space for everyone.

**Key Takeaways:**

*   Treat everyone with respect and courtesy.
*   Embrace diversity and strive for inclusivity.
*   Communicate constructively and professionally.
*   Harassment and discrimination will not be tolerated.
*   This CoC applies to all community interactions and spaces.

**Next Steps:**

*   **Familiarize Yourself:** Please read this Code of Conduct thoroughly.
*   **Practice It:** Actively embody these principles in all your community interactions.
*   **Speak Up:** If you witness or experience behavior that violates this CoC, please report it through the designated channels (these should be clearly communicated elsewhere, e.g., a community website or event information page). Reporting procedures typically involve contacting specific community moderators, organizers, or a dedicated CoC committee.
*   **Ask Questions:** If anything in this CoC is unclear, please seek clarification from community leaders or organizers.

Thank you for helping make our community a welcoming and productive place for all!
