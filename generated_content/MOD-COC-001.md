**Introduction:**

A Community Code of Conduct (COC) is a set of guidelines that outlines acceptable behavior within a community.  It's crucial for fostering a positive, inclusive, and productive environment for everyone involved.  Without a COC, negative behaviors can easily proliferate, driving away valuable members and harming the overall health of the community. This document explains our community's COC, its importance, and how it relates to our mission pillars.


**1. The Rules: Our Community Code of Conduct**

Our community thrives on mutual respect and collaboration.  To ensure this, we adhere to the following rules:

* **Be Respectful:** Treat all members with courtesy and consideration, regardless of their background, experience, or opinions.  Avoid personal attacks, insults, or harassment.
* **Be Inclusive:**  Welcome and embrace diversity.  Actively work to create a space where everyone feels safe and included.  Challenge discriminatory or exclusionary behavior.
* **Be Constructive:** Focus on contributing positively to discussions and projects.  Offer helpful feedback and suggestions, rather than criticism for the sake of it.
* **Be Responsible:** Take ownership of your actions and their consequences.  Be accountable for your contributions and behavior.
* **Follow the Law:**  All activity within the community must comply with all applicable laws and regulations.
* **No Harassment:**  This includes, but is not limited to, bullying, intimidation, sexual harassment, hate speech, and discriminatory language.
* **No Spam or Unsolicited Advertising:**  Do not post irrelevant or unsolicited promotional content.
* **Respect Intellectual Property:**  Do not share or use copyrighted material without permission.
* **Use Appropriate Language:**  Avoid profanity, offensive language, and overly aggressive communication.


**2. How It Works**

The COC is not just a list of rules; it's a living document that guides our interactions.  It relies on the active participation of all community members to report violations and uphold the standards of respectful behavior.  We encourage proactive reporting of any behavior that violates this code.  We will investigate reported violations and take appropriate action, which may include warnings, temporary suspensions, or permanent bans.  The specific actions taken will depend on the severity and context of the violation.


**3. Applications**

The COC applies to all aspects of community interaction, including:

* **Online Forums:**  Discussions, comments, and posts.
* **In-Person Events:**  Meetings, workshops, and conferences.
* **Private Communication:**  Emails, direct messages, and other private channels.


**4. Limitations**

While we strive to create a welcoming and inclusive environment, we cannot guarantee the complete absence of negative behavior.  The COC provides a framework for addressing violations, but it cannot prevent every instance of misconduct.  We rely on the active participation of our members to report violations and help maintain a positive community.
