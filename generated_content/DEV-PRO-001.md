# SME-Focused Prompt Templates: Leveraging Your Expertise with AI

**Content ID:** DEV-PRO-001

## 1. Introduction: Why Prompt Templates Matter for SMEs

As Subject Matter Experts (SMEs), your deep knowledge is invaluable. Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, Claude, or internal company models offer powerful capabilities, but getting consistent, reliable, and relevant results requires clear instructions. This is where **Prompt Templates** come in.

Think of a prompt template as a structured guide or recipe for interacting with an AI. Instead of starting from scratch each time, you use a pre-defined format with placeholders for specific details.

**Why is this important for you?**

*   **Consistency:** Ensures the AI receives instructions in a standardized way, leading to more predictable outputs.
*   **Efficiency:** Saves time by eliminating the need to craft complex prompts repeatedly.
*   **Knowledge Capture:** Allows you to embed your expertise and context directly into the AI's instructions.
*   **Scalability:** Enables others (or automated systems) to leverage your defined process easily.
*   **Control & Safety:** Helps implement guardrails for responsible AI use.

This document provides intermediate technical staff, particularly SMEs with potentially limited AI expertise, with the knowledge and tools to effectively use and adapt prompt templates for their specific business functions, incorporating principles of SME Relevance and Responsible AI. Our goal is for you to be able to adapt at least 3 templates for your work, complete with appropriate safety guardrails.

## 2. Key Concepts: Understanding Prompt Templates

### 2.1 What are Prompt Templates?

A prompt template is a reusable text structure containing:

*   **Fixed Instructions:** Standard text that guides the AI's task, tone, format, and constraints.
*   **Placeholders (Variables):** Specific markers (often enclosed in curly braces, like `{{variable_name}}`) that are replaced with actual data before the prompt is sent to the LLM.

**Analogy:** Imagine a fill-in-the-blanks form or a Mad Libs puzzle. The fixed text provides the structure and context, while the blanks (`{{placeholders}}`) are where you insert the specific details for each unique situation.

**Example Structure:**

```
Summarize the following technical document for a non-technical audience.
Focus on the key findings and implications.
Limit the summary to {{max_length}} words.
Maintain a {{tone}} tone.

Document Content:
{{document_text}}

Key Findings:
{{key_findings_guess}} // Optional: Provide initial guess or context

Implications:
{{implications_guess}} // Optional: Provide initial guess or context
```

### 2.2 How Prompt Templates Work

1.  **Define the Template:** Create the text structure with fixed instructions and placeholders (`{{placeholder}}`).
2.  **Populate the Placeholders:** Before using the template, replace each placeholder with the relevant information for the specific task (e.g., replace `{{document_text}}` with the actual text of the document).
3.  **Submit the Prompt:** Send the completed prompt (template text + filled placeholders) to the LLM.
4.  **Receive Output:** The LLM processes the detailed instructions and context, generating a response tailored to the specific inputs provided.

### 2.3 Applications for SMEs

Prompt templates can streamline various SME tasks:

*   **Data Extraction:** Extract specific information (e.g., part numbers, key dates, technical specifications) from unstructured text like reports, emails, or logs.
    *   *Template Idea: Extract `{{entity_type}}` from the following `{{source_document_type}}`.*
*   **Content Generation:** Draft initial versions of technical summaries, FAQs based on documentation, requirement outlines, or explanations of complex concepts.
    *   *Template Idea: Generate 5 FAQs based on the following `{{technical_specification}}` for an audience of `{{target_audience}}`.*
*   **Analysis & Summarization:** Summarize meeting transcripts, identify key themes in customer feedback, or condense lengthy technical articles.
    *   *Template Idea: Summarize the key decisions and action items from the following meeting notes: `{{meeting_notes}}`.*
*   **Code Assistance:** Explain code snippets in plain language, generate boilerplate code based on requirements, or translate code between similar languages.
    *   *Template Idea: Explain the following `{{language}}` code snippet step-by-step: `{{code_snippet}}`.*
*   **Structured Q&A:** Answer questions based *only* on a provided document or knowledge base, ensuring answers stay within the defined context.
    *   *Template Idea: Based *only* on the provided context below, answer the question. If the answer is not in the context, say "Information not found". Context: `{{knowledge_base_excerpt}}`. Question: `{{user_question}}`.*

### 2.4 Limitations and Considerations

*   **Input Quality:** The quality of the AI's output heavily depends on the quality and relevance of the information provided in the placeholders ("Garbage In, Garbage Out").
*   **Rigidity:** Overly strict templates might not adapt well to unexpected inputs or novel situations. Flexibility in design is key.
*   **Complexity:** Designing effective templates requires understanding the task, the AI's capabilities, and potential failure points. It's an iterative process.
*   **Bias Amplification:** Poorly designed templates or biased input data can lead the AI to generate biased or unfair outputs.
*   **Over-Reliance:** Templates are tools, not replacements for critical thinking. Always review and validate AI-generated outputs.

## 3. Mission Pillar: SME Relevance

Prompt templates are powerful tools for ensuring AI outputs are directly relevant to your specific domain and expertise.

*   **Embedding Expertise:** Templates allow you to encode your knowledge about *how* a task should be performed. You define the important parameters, the desired output format, the constraints, and the context the AI needs â€“ things only an SME truly understands.
*   **Solving Real Problems:** By focusing templates on specific, recurring tasks within your workflow (e.g., summarizing compliance reports, extracting failure codes from logs), you ensure AI is applied to genuine business needs, not just generic tasks.
*   **Bridging the Gap:** Templates act as a bridge, allowing SMEs with limited AI coding skills to effectively instruct and leverage powerful LLMs using structured natural language.
*   **Contextual Accuracy:** Providing specific context via placeholders (e.g., `{{product_specification}}`, `{{regulatory_guideline}}`) helps the LLM generate responses that are accurate and relevant within your specific operational environment.
*   **Task Decomposition:** You can break down complex SME tasks into smaller sub-tasks, each handled by a specific, well-defined prompt template, making complex processes more manageable for AI.

**In Practice:** When designing or adapting a template, always ask: "Does this template accurately reflect the nuances and requirements of this task from my SME perspective? Does it use the terminology and consider the constraints relevant to my field?"

## 4. Mission Pillar: Responsible AI

Using AI powerful tools like LLMs comes with responsibilities. Prompt templates are crucial for implementing Responsible AI practices.

*   **Guardrails and Constraints:** Templates allow you to build in explicit instructions that act as guardrails.
    *   *Example:* "Respond based *only* on the provided text.", "Do not provide financial advice.", "Maintain a neutral and objective tone.", "Limit the response to `{{max_tokens}}` tokens.", "Output the result as a JSON object with keys 'item' and 'status'."
*   **Bias Mitigation:**
    *   **Input Awareness:** Be mindful of potentially biased data used to fill placeholders.
    *   **Neutral Phrasing:** Design template instructions to be neutral and avoid leading questions or assumptions that could trigger biased responses.
    *   **Output Checking:** Include instructions to check for fairness or specify undesirable output characteristics (e.g., "Ensure the summary does not contain stereotypes."). Regularly review outputs for hidden biases.
*   **Transparency:** While the LLM itself is complex, a well-defined template makes the *input* given to the model clear and understandable. This helps in debugging unexpected outputs and understanding what instructions led to a specific result.
*   **Accuracy and Factuality:**
    *   *Prompting for Grounding:* Instruct the AI to base its answers strictly on provided source material (`{{source_text}}`).
    *   *Requesting Citations:* For tasks involving research or knowledge synthesis, prompt the AI to cite sources if possible (though verification is still crucial).
    *   *Encouraging Verification:* Remind users (potentially within the template's surrounding workflow) that AI outputs require SME review and verification, especially for critical tasks.
*   **Data Privacy and Security:**
    *   **Avoid Sensitive Data:** Design templates to minimize or avoid the need for Personally Identifiable Information (PII) or sensitive company data in placeholders whenever possible.
    *   **Adhere to Policies:** Always follow company data handling policies when populating templates. If sensitive data *must* be used, ensure the AI system and processes are approved for handling it securely. Do not input sensitive data into public-facing AI tools.

**In Practice:** When adapting a template, explicitly consider: "What could go wrong with this prompt? How can I add instructions to prevent harmful, biased, or inaccurate outputs? Does this template encourage handling data appropriately?"

## 5. Practical Components: Getting Started

To help you effectively use SME-focused prompt templates, here are key practical components:

### 5.1 Template Library (Examples)

A central library provides tested, reusable templates. Here are a few examples to adapt:

**Template 1: Technical Summary**

```markdown

A2: [Answer]
...

**Document Text:**
```
{{document_text}}
```

**Generated FAQs:**
```
```

### 5.2 Customization Guide

Adapting templates for your specific needs is key. Follow these steps:

1.  **Identify the Task & Goal:** Clearly define what you want the AI to do. What is the input? What is the desired output? Who is the audience?
2.  **Choose a Base Template:** Select the closest template from the library or start from scratch if needed.
3.  **Define Placeholders:** Identify the parts of the task that will change with each use. These become your `{{placeholders}}`. Be specific (e.g., use `{{customer_email_text}}` instead of just `{{text}}`).
4.  **Refine Instructions:**
    *   Be specific and unambiguous. Avoid jargon the AI might not know unless defined.
    *   Specify the desired **format** (e.g., bullet points, JSON, paragraph).
    *   Define the required **tone** (e.g., formal, friendly, technical).
    *   Set **constraints** (e.g., length limits, information sources).
    *   Consider adding **role-playing** (e.g., "You are a helpful technical support agent...").
5.  **Add Guardrails (Responsible AI):** Explicitly add instructions to prevent undesirable outcomes.
    *   "Do not include any personal opinions."
    *   "Base the answer solely on the provided context."
    *   "If the request is ambiguous or potentially harmful, politely decline to answer."
    *   "Avoid making assumptions about the user."
6.  **Iterate and Test:** Template creation is rarely perfect on the first try. Test with different inputs and refine based on the results (see Testing Framework below).

### 5.3 Testing Framework

Thorough testing ensures your templates are effective, reliable, and responsible.

1.  **Define Success Criteria:** What does a "good" output look like for this template? Be specific.
    *   *Example (for Summary Template):* Is it accurate? Is it the right length? Is the tone appropriate? Does it capture the key points? Does it avoid introducing outside information?
2.  **Prepare Test Cases:** Create a set of diverse inputs to test the template thoroughly. Include:
    *   **Typical Inputs:** Standard data the template will usually handle.
    *   **Edge Cases:** Unusual data, empty inputs, very long inputs, slightly malformed data.
    *   **Boundary Cases:** Inputs that test the limits of your constraints (e.g., text exactly at the maximum length).
    *   **Potential Bias Triggers:** Inputs that might inadvertently lead to biased outputs (if applicable).
3.  **Execute Prompts:** Populate the template with your test case data and run the prompts through the LLM.
4.  **Evaluate Outputs:** Carefully review the LLM's responses against your success criteria. Check for:
    *   **Accuracy:** Is the information correct?
    *   **Completeness:** Does it fulfill all instructions?
    *   **Format:** Is the output structured as requested?
    *   **Tone:** Is the tone appropriate?
    *   **Relevance:** Is the output relevant to the input and SME context?
    *   **Responsibility:** Are there any signs of bias, hallucination, or harmful content? Did it respect the guardrails?
5.  **Refine Template:** Based on the evaluation, modify the template's instructions, placeholders, or guardrails to improve performance. Repeat testing until satisfied.
6.  **Log (Optional but Recommended):** Keep records of test inputs, prompts, outputs, and evaluations. This helps track improvements and debug issues.
