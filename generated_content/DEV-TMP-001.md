# DEV-TMP-001: Basic RAG System Template

**Target Audience:** AI Engineers (Expert Level)

**Objective:** Developers will deploy a functioning RAG system using their own data within 2 hours, with proper evaluation metrics.

**Introduction:**

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems combine the strengths of large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge bases.  This allows LLMs to access and process information beyond their training data, significantly improving accuracy, factual consistency, and the ability to handle nuanced or specialized queries. This guide provides a streamlined template for building a basic RAG system, focusing on rapid deployment and practical application for expert AI engineers with limited time.

**1. Key Concepts and Architecture:**

A basic RAG system typically involves three main components:

1. **Document Retriever:** This component indexes and searches a knowledge base (e.g., a collection of PDFs, text files, or a database) to retrieve relevant documents given a user query.  Popular choices include FAISS, Elasticsearch, or ChromaDB.  Vector databases are preferred for semantic search capabilities.

2. **Document Reader/Embedding Generator:** This component processes the retrieved documents, extracts key information, and generates embeddings (vector representations) for each document or passage. Sentence Transformers are commonly used for this purpose.

3. **Large Language Model (LLM):**  This component receives the user query and the relevant document embeddings/text from the retriever. It uses this information to generate a comprehensive and contextually accurate response.  OpenAI's API, Hugging Face models, or other LLMs can be used.

**2. Step-by-Step Guide (Python):**

This guide uses FAISS for retrieval, Sentence Transformers for embeddings, and the OpenAI API for the LLM.  Adapt as needed for your chosen components.

1. **Data Preparation:**  Preprocess your data (e.g., cleaning, splitting into chunks).
2. **Embedding Generation:**
   ```python
   from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
   model = SentenceTransformer('all-mpnet-base-v2') # Or your preferred model
   embeddings = model.encode(your_documents)
   ```
3. **Index Creation (FAISS):**
   ```python
   import faiss
   index = faiss.IndexFlatIP(len(embeddings[0])) # Inner Product search
   index.add(embeddings)
   ```
4. **Retrieval Function:**
   ```python
   def retrieve(query, top_k=5):
       query_embedding = model.encode(query)
       D, I = index.search(query_embedding.reshape(1, -1), top_k)
       return [your_documents[i] for i in I[0]]
   ```
5. **LLM Integration (OpenAI):**
   ```python
   import openai
   openai.api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"
   def generate_response(query, retrieved_docs):
       prompt = f"Answer the following question using the provided context:\n\nQuestion: {query}\n\nContext: {''.join(retrieved_docs)}\n\nAnswer:"
       response = openai.Completion.create(engine="text-davinci-003", prompt=prompt, max_tokens=150)
       return response.choices[0].text.strip()
   ```
6. **Putting it Together:**
   ```python
   user_query = input("Enter your query: ")
   retrieved_documents = retrieve(user_query)
   answer = generate_response(user_query, retrieved_documents)
   print(answer)
   ```

**3. Evaluation Script:**

Use standard evaluation metrics like:

* **Mean Average Precision (MAP):** Measures the average precision across multiple queries.
* **Recall@k:** Measures the proportion of relevant documents retrieved in the top k results.
* **F1-score:** Harmonically averages precision and recall.
* **Human Evaluation:** Essential for assessing the quality and coherence of generated answers.  Develop a rubric for human evaluation based on accuracy, relevance, and fluency.

**4. SME Relevance:**

This RAG system template is highly relevant to subject matter experts (SMEs) because it allows them to easily integrate their domain-specific knowledge into the system. By providing their own data, SMEs can leverage the power of LLMs to answer complex questions within their area of expertise, improving decision-making and knowledge sharing.  This empowers SMEs to become active participants in the AI pipeline.

**5. Economic Sustainability:**

This template prioritizes efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Using readily available open-source tools (FAISS, Sentence Transformers) minimizes reliance on expensive proprietary software.  While LLM API calls incur costs, the efficient retrieval mechanism reduces the number of tokens processed, thus optimizing cost. The rapid deployment time also translates to faster time-to-market for applications built upon this system.


**6. Limitations:**

* **Data Quality:** The accuracy of the RAG system is heavily dependent on the quality and relevance of the provided data.
* **Hallucination:** LLMs can still generate incorrect or nonsensical information, even when provided with context.
* **Scalability:**  For very large datasets, more sophisticated indexing and retrieval techniques might be necessary.
* **Bias:**  The data used to train the LLM and the knowledge base itself may contain biases, which can be reflected in the system's output.


**Conclusion:**

This guide provides a foundational template for building a functional RAG system quickly. By focusing on efficient components and clear steps, AI engineers can leverage this template to integrate their own data and build powerful, contextually aware applications. Remember to thoroughly evaluate your system and address its limitations to ensure accuracy and reliability.  Further exploration should focus on optimizing the retrieval method, experimenting with different LLMs and embedding models, and implementing robust error handling and bias mitigation strategies.
