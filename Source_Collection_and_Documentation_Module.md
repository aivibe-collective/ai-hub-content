## Source Collection Process

### 1. Source Identification

During initial draft creation:

1. **Mark Source Requirements**:

   - Be specific about the type of information needed:

     ```markdown
     [SOURCE NEEDED: Statistics on AI adoption rates among SMEs in 2023]
     [SOURCE NEEDED: Definition of transformer architecture]
     [SOURCE NEEDED: Case example of successful implementation in retail]
     ```

2. **Create Source Request Log**:
   - Compile all [SOURCE NEEDED] tags into a structured log
   - Categorize by information type
   - Prioritize based on importance to the content

### 2. Source Research

For each identified source need:

1. **Search Relevant Repositories**:
   - **Academic databases**: Google Scholar, IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library
   - **Industry sources**: Gartner, Forrester, McKinsey, industry associations
   - **Government/NGO publications**: EU AI Act, NIST, ISO standards
   - **Tech publications**: Reputable journals, conference proceedings
   - **Hub-specific resources**: Internal knowledge base, previous content

2. **Document Potential Sources**:

   ```markdown

```

#### Parenthetical Citations

Place the citation at the end of the relevant information:

```markdown
AI adoption among SMEs has increased by 15% since 2022 (McKinsey & Company, 2023).
```

### Quoting, Paraphrasing, and Summarizing

1. **Direct Quotes**:
   - Use sparingly for definitions, key insights, or powerful statements

## Examples

### Example 1: Technical Concept with Source

```markdown
### 2.1 Transformer Architecture in Large Language Models

Transformer architecture forms the foundation of modern large language models (LLMs). First introduced by Vaswani et al. (2017) in their seminal paper "Attention Is All You Need," transformers revolutionized natural language processing by replacing recurrent neural networks with self-attention mechanisms. This architecture enables models to process all words in a sequence simultaneously rather than sequentially, dramatically improving both performance and training efficiency.

The key innovation of transformer models is the self-attention mechanism, which allows the model to weigh the importance of different words in relation to each other, regardless of their position in the sequence (Vaswani et al., 2017). For SMEs implementing AI solutions, understanding this fundamental architecture helps in selecting appropriate pre-trained models and fine-tuning approaches for specific business applications.
```

### Example 2: Statistical Data with Source

```markdown
## Current State of AI Adoption

The landscape of AI adoption among SMEs has evolved rapidly in recent years. According to McKinsey & Company's 2023 global survey, 47% of small and medium enterprises have implemented at least one AI solution, representing a 15% increase from 2022 (McKinsey & Company, 2023). This growth has been particularly pronounced in sectors with data-intensive operations, such as retail and financial services.

[FIGURE: AI Adoption Rates by Industry Sector, 2021-2023. Source: Adapted from McKinsey & Company (2023)]

However, adoption rates vary significantly by region. The European Union Agency for Cybersecurity reports that European SMEs lag behind their North American counterparts, with only 33% reporting active AI implementation (ENISA, 2023). This regional disparity highlights the importance of considering geographic context when discussing AI adoption strategies.
```

### Example 3: Case Study with Source

```markdown
### Practical Implementation Example

**Case Study: AI-Powered Inventory Management at MidSize Retail**

A medium-sized retail chain with 25 locations implemented an AI-based inventory management system to optimize stock levels and reduce waste. According to the documented case study (Retail AI Consortium, 2023), the implementation followed a phased approach:

1. Initial data integration and cleaning (6 weeks)
2. Algorithm training on historical sales data (4 weeks)
3. Pilot implementation in three stores (8 weeks)
4. Full deployment across all locations (12 weeks)

The results demonstrated significant business impact: "The AI system reduced excess inventory by 23% and stockouts by 17% within the first six months of full implementation, resulting in approximately €450,000 in annual savings" (Retail AI Consortium, 2023, p. 8).

This case illustrates how SMEs can achieve meaningful ROI from AI implementations when focusing on specific, high-value business problems with measurable outcomes.
