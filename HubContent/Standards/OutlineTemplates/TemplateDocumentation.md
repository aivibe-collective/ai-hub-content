* **Target Audience:** Varies depending on the template (SME owner, developer, project manager, etc.).

**Documentation Title:** (e.g., AI Project Ethics Checklist Template Documentation, AI ROI Calculator Spreadsheet Guide for SMEs)

**1. Introduction:**

* **What is This Template/Toolkit?** Clearly state the name and nature of the file(s) provided (e.g., "This is a spreadsheet template," "This is a markdown checklist file").
* **Who is it For?** Define the target audience for this specific template/toolkit.
* **What Problem Does It Help Solve?** Explain the specific task or challenge this template/toolkit assists the user with.
* **Measurable Goal:** What outcome can a user expect from *using* this template effectively? (e.g., "Systematically identify ethical risks for an AI project," "Estimate the potential return on investment for an AI initiative").
* **Mission Focus:** Explicitly state which primary mission pillar(s) this template directly supports (e.g., Responsible AI-Ethics, Economic Sustainability, SME-Planning).

**2. What It Is & Why Use It:**

* Provide a brief description of the template/toolkit's structure, components, and purpose.
* Explain the benefits of using it compared to doing the task manually or without guidance. How does it support good practices related to the mission pillars?

**3. How to Use the Template/Toolkit:**

* Provide clear, step-by-step instructions on **how to access, fill out, use, or adapt** the template/toolkit file(s).
* Use visuals (screenshots, simple diagrams) if it's a document/spreadsheet or requires specific software.
* Explain the purpose of each section, question, input field, or tab within the template. Provide examples of valid inputs or expected responses.
* Address any specific requirements or considerations (e.g., "This checklist should be reviewed weekly by the project team," "Inputs for the ROI calculator should be based on realistic, documented estimates," "Ensure macros are enabled if applicable").

**4. Underlying Principles & Guidance:**

* Explain the core concepts or framework the template is based on (e.g., the key ethical principles reflected in the checklist questions, the variables included in an ROI calculation and why).
* Provide guidance on **interpreting the results or outputs** from using the template (e.g., "If you answer 'No' or 'Unsure' to any question in Section B, flag this as a high-priority risk requiring immediate attention," "An ROI greater than 100% suggests potential profitability, but consider the confidence level of your inputs and review the Assumptions tab").
* Link to relevant modules or guides in the Hub that provide deeper context or explain the underlying principles in more detail (e.g., link ethics checklist to Ethical AI modules, link ROI calculator to Economic Sustainability guidance).

**5. Examples / Use Cases:**

* Show a partially or fully completed example template/toolkit for a hypothetical, **realistic SME scenario**.
* Describe different types of scenarios or projects where the template/toolkit would be particularly useful.

**6. Customization & Adaptability:**
