# Content Outline Template: Practical "How-To" Guide

This template is for creating focused guides that walk users through completing a specific task or workflow, with a strong emphasis on practicality and mission-aligned execution.

* **Target Audience:** Often Beginner to Intermediate, including non-technical users for low-code guides.

---

**Guide Title:** (Action-oriented, e.g., How to Set Up an Automated Customer Email Classifier with Zapier and OpenAI, Deploying a Simple Image Recognition Model on AWS Free Tier)

**1. Introduction:**

* **What You'll Do:** Clearly state the specific, tangible task or workflow this guide helps you complete.
* **Target Audience:** Define the audience, including assumed technical level (e.g., no coding required, basic scripting, moderate technical background).
* **Measurable Goal:** What is the clear, measurable outcome of successfully following this guide? (e.g., "You will have a working email classifier," "You will successfully deploy a model," "You will set up an automated report").
* **Prerequisites & Estimated Time:** List everything needed before starting (accounts, software, data format) and provide an **Estimated time** to complete the guide.
* **Mission Focus:** How does successfully completing *this specific task* relate to the Hub's mission pillars (e.g., saving time = economic sustainability, reducing manual effort = efficiency, handling data responsibly)?

**2. Why Do This (Brief Context):**

* Briefly explain the benefits of completing this task, its relevance for SMEs or other target audiences. Provide context on underlying concepts if necessary, but focus on the *what* and *why* rather than deep technical theory.

**3. Step-by-Step Guide:**

* Provide clear, numbered steps to complete the task.
* Use **lots of visuals (screenshots, short video demos, step-by-step flowcharts/diagrams for complex workflows).**
* Explicitly state tools/platforms used for each step, **highlighting cost implications, free tiers, and potential alternatives.**
* **For Non-Technical Users:** Clearly differentiate steps involving code (if any) from platform/tool usage. Provide **alternative no-code/low-code tool steps** where feasible and clearly marked. Use plain language throughout this section.
* *Integrated:* Weave in specific steps or considerations related to mission pillars *directly within the workflow* (e.g., "Step 5: Before uploading data, ensure it is anonymized following [link to privacy guide]," "Step 8: When choosing your server instance, select one optimized for [efficiency metric]," "Step 12: Add a step to log model predictions for audit purposes").

**4. Responsible & Sustainable Implementation Tips (Contextualized):**

* *Specific* ethical, privacy, security points *directly relevant to performing this exact task* (e.g., "Ensure data processed by the classifier is handled securely and complies with GDPR if processing personal data," "Be aware of potential bias in the model used and its impact on classification results," "Monitor API key usage for security and cost to prevent unauthorized use or unexpected bills").
* *Specific* environmental or economic sustainability tips *for this task* (e.g., "Monitor compute costs regularly using the cloud dashboard," "If using a cloud platform, choose the most cost/energy-efficient region available," "Estimate the ROI based on time saved by automating this task versus manual execution").
* Link to deeper resources (Section 5 in Hub structure) for more context on these specific issues.

**5. Troubleshooting & Common Issues:**

* What might go wrong when following this guide? How to identify and fix common errors?

**6. Variations & Next Steps:**

* How can this task/guide be adapted for slightly different scenarios? What other guides or modules build on the skills learned here? Link to community forum for help.

**7. Tags:**

* List relevant tags based on the primary and secondary mission pillars, audience level, topic, sector (if applicable), specific tools/technologies used, and format. (e.g., #HowTo, #SME-Automation, #Deployment, #Sustainability-Economic, #ResponsibleAI-Privacy, #Beginner/Intermediate, #NoCode, #Zapier, #OpenAI)

**8. References** (Optional)

* Link to official tool documentation or other relevant resources.
