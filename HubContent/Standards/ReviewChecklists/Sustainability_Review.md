**Instructions:** Go through the content, paying close attention to Section 4 (Responsible AI & Sustainability) and any integrated points in practical/application sections. Check the points below. Provide specific feedback and suggested improvements.

**Checklist:**

* **Environmental Sustainability:**
  * [ ] Yes / No - Does the content identify the *specific* environmental impacts relevant to the topic (e.g., energy consumption of training/inference, data storage)?
  * [ ] Yes / No - Does the content offer **practical strategies** to minimize these environmental impacts (e.g., model choice tips, efficiency techniques, hardware selection)?
  * [ ] Yes / No - Where applicable, does the content guide on *how to measure* environmental impact using specific tools (e.g., CodeCarbon) or methods?
  * [ ] Yes / No - Are **benchmarks for efficiency** or methods to reduce footprint discussed where relevant?
* **Economic Sustainability (especially for SMEs):**
  * [ ] Yes / No - Does the content identify the *specific* cost implications relevant to the topic (e.g., compute costs, tool licenses, implementation costs)?
  * [ ] Yes / No - Does the content offer **practical strategies** for cost-effectiveness (e.g., leveraging free tiers, open source, optimization tips)?
  * [ ] Yes / No - Is **guidance on estimating ROI** or business value provided where relevant (especially for Apply AI content)?
  * [ ] Yes / No - Are the suggested tools/approaches evaluated in terms of their economic feasibility for the target audience (e.g., SMEs)?
* **Integration:**
  * [ ] Yes / No - Is sustainability integrated into the *practical* steps, examples, or tool usage where relevant, not just discussed in a separate section?
  * [ ] Yes / No - Does the content emphasize sustainable practices as a valuable outcome of learning/applying the technology?
* **Accuracy and Actionability:**
  * [ ] Yes / No - Is the information about environmental impacts, measurement tools, and cost-saving strategies accurate and actionable?
  * [ ] Yes / No - If sustainability measurement is included in an activity, are instructions clear on *interpreting* the results and *acting* on them?
* **Case Studies/Playbooks:**
  * [ ] Yes / No - If a case study/playbook, does it clearly articulate how environmental and economic sustainability practices were implemented *in that specific scenario*?
  * [ ] Yes / No - Are **quantifiable outcomes related to sustainability** (e.g., X% cost reduction, Y% energy saving, Z ROI) highlighted where applicable?

**Specific Feedback and Suggested Improvements:**

[Provide detailed notes on specific impacts missed, unclear strategies, missing measurement guidance, or areas where economic or environmental aspects could be stronger.]
