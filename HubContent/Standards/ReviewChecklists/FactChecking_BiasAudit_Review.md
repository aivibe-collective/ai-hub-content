**Content Item:** [Link or Name of Content Item being reviewed]

**Review Date:** YYYY-MM-DD

**Instructions:** Verify factual claims. Critically assess the content for subtle or overt biases. Note any AI-specific hallucination/bias issues if the draft was AI-generated.

**Checklist:**

* **Fact-Checking:**
  * [ ] Yes / No - Are all statistics, numbers, dates, and specific claims verified against reliable sources?
  * [ ] Yes / No - Are sources for factual claims explicitly cited or linked where appropriate?
  * [ ] Yes / No - Are external links valid and pointing to reputable sources?
  * [ ] Yes / No - Is information about tools, libraries, or platforms accurate (e.g., features, compatibility, current status)?
  * [ ] Yes / No - If summarizing research or reports (e.g., Policy Summaries), does the content accurately reflect the source material?
  * [ ] Yes / No - Are case study outcomes and details accurately represented based on provided data/interviews?
* **Bias Audit (Content & Language):**
  * [ ] Yes / No - Does the language used avoid stereotypes (gender, race, age, region, etc.)?
  * [ ] Yes / No - Are examples and scenarios inclusive and representative of diverse groups and contexts (including global diversity)?
  * [ ] Yes / No - Does the content present different perspectives fairly, where applicable (e.g., ethical debates)?
  * [ ] Yes / No - Does the content avoid making assumptions about the user's background, resources, or location unless explicitly stated for the target audience?
* **Bias Audit (AI-Generated Content Specific):**
  * [ ] Yes / No - If the draft was partially or wholly AI-generated, has it been checked for factual hallucinations?
  * [ ] Yes / No - If AI-generated, has the language been audited for subtle biases potentially introduced by the AI model itself?
  * [ ] Yes / No - Were tools like Perspective API or similar used to help audit AI-generated text for toxicity or bias indicators? (Document findings).
* **Bias Audit (Technical Concepts/Tools):**
  * [ ] Yes / No - Does the content appropriately highlight potential sources of bias *within* the technical concepts or tools being explained (linking to Responsible AI section)?
