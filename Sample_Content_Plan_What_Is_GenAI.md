# Content Plan: What is Generative AI?

**Content ID:** LRN-BEG-001  
**Section:** Learn AI  
**Subsection:** Beginner - Foundations of Generative AI  
**Content Type:** Learning Module  

## 1. Purpose, Target Audience & Measurable Goals

### Specific Goal
This module will explain the fundamental concept of generative AI, its capabilities, and its distinctions from traditional AI approaches, providing a solid foundation for beginners to build upon in subsequent modules.

### Target Audience
- **Technical Level:** Beginner, No prior AI knowledge assumed
- **Role/Context:** 
  - Primary: SME owners and decision-makers evaluating AI adoption
  - Secondary: Non-technical staff who need to understand AI concepts
- **Existing Knowledge:** Basic digital literacy, no AI or ML prerequisites
- **Typical Resource Constraints:**
  - Limited time (busy professionals)
  - Limited technical background
  - Potential budget constraints for implementation
  - Possible skepticism about AI relevance or complexity

### Measurable Objectives (SMART)
By completing this module, users will be able to:
1. Explain the basic concept of generative AI in their own words to a colleague
2. Identify at least 3 potential applications of generative AI relevant to their specific business context
3. Distinguish between generative AI and traditional AI approaches using a provided comparison framework
4. Complete a simple use case template identifying one potential generative AI application for their business, including expected benefits and considerations

## 2. Primary Mission Pillars & Specific Connections

### Primary Mission Pillars
1. **Responsible AI:** Introducing ethical considerations from the very beginning
2. **SME Relevance:** Ensuring practical business applications for small/medium enterprises

### Specific Connections to Other Mission Pillars

#### Environmental & Economic Sustainability
- Highlight the range of resource requirements for different generative AI approaches
- Discuss the concept of model size and its relationship to computing resources
- Introduce the idea of "right-sizing" AI solutions for SME needs and resources
- Mention cloud-based options that can reduce upfront infrastructure costs

#### Global Inclusion
- Acknowledge language capabilities and limitations of current generative AI
- Highlight examples of generative AI applications from diverse global contexts
- Consider accessibility implications for generated content
- Address potential barriers to adoption in different regional contexts

## 3. Content Outline Structure

This content will follow the Learning Module template with the following adaptations:

- **Enhanced Visual Elements:** Additional diagrams and simplified visualizations to explain technical concepts
- **Extended Real-World Examples:** More diverse business examples across different sectors and regions
- **Simplified Hands-on Activity:** Modified to require no coding or technical setup
- **Added Resource Section:** Curated list of free tools and resources specifically for SMEs

## 4. Practical Components

### Interactive Components
1. **AI Capabilities Explorer:** Interactive tool allowing users to explore different types of generative outputs (text, image, code) through pre-built examples
2. **Use Case Template:** Fillable template for identifying and documenting a potential generative AI use case for the user's business
3. **Self-Assessment Quiz:** Simple knowledge check with explanatory feedback

### Resource Requirements
- All interactive components will be web-based requiring only a browser
- No specialized software installation needed
- Activities designed to complete in under 15 minutes each
- Low bandwidth versions will be available

### Success Measurement
- Completion of the use case template with specific, relevant information
- Score of 70% or higher on the self-assessment quiz
- Ability to correctly categorize example AI applications as generative or non-generative

## 5. Development Notes

### SME Input Required
- Need input from 2-3 SME owners who have successfully implemented generative AI
- Gather diverse examples across retail, services, and manufacturing sectors
- Validate use case template with potential users

### Potential Challenges
- Explaining technical concepts without technical language
- Balancing optimism about capabilities with realistic expectations
- Addressing potential job displacement concerns constructively

### Integration Points
- This module serves as a foundation for all subsequent beginner track modules
- Will reference the SME Playbooks for sector-specific examples
- Will link to the ROI Calculator in the Templates & Toolkits section

## 6. Review Considerations

### Technical Accuracy
- Ensure definitions are technically accurate while remaining accessible
- Validate that simplifications don't create misconceptions
- Verify all examples are technically feasible

### Responsible AI Review
- Ensure balanced presentation of benefits and limitations
- Include appropriate ethical considerations from the beginning
- Avoid overpromising on capabilities

### Inclusion & Accessibility
- Ensure examples represent diverse business contexts and regions
- Check language for cultural assumptions
- Verify accessibility of all interactive components
